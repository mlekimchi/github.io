My friend said he had created his own math notation! His notation worked perfectly for him but was unreadable for others. I can't imagine writing expressions in any other way!

Turns out, there are other ways.

### x-Fix expressions
Our standard notation is called infix. We use parenthesis to indicate the order of operations. Operators are between the two operands.

```(A+B)*C```

In my data structures class, I learned about prefix and postfix notation. The pre/post refers to the location of the operator and allows you to write expressions without delimiters.

| Postfix     | Infix       |  Prefix     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ```AB+C*```       | ```(A+B)*C```   | ```*+ABC```       |

For a lab, we used stacks to read translate x-fix expressions into y-fix expressions. Here is a great calculator which shows how to push/pop from the stack, [Prefix-Postfix Converter by raj457036](https://raj457036.github.io/Simple-Tools/prefixAndPostfixConvertor.html).

This lab was interesting because I normally code as an ends to a mean. This was probably the first time I tried to code with attention to....coding style?? [Here is my readme and analysis of my code](https://adaptive-market-2e2.notion.site/Lab-1-4f29903228f84310a218fe68fed32818).
