My friend said he had created his own math notation! His notation worked perfectly for him but was unreadable for others. I can't imagine writing expressions in any other way!

Turns out, there are other ways.

Our standard notation is called infix. We use parenthesis to indicate the order of operations. Operators are between the two operands.

```(A+B)*C```

In my data structures class, I learned about prefix and postfix notation. The pre/post refers to the location of the operator and allows you to write expressions without delimiters.

| Postfix     | Infix       |  Prefix     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ```AB+C*```       | ```(A+B)*C```   | ```*+ABC```       |

We used stacks to read translate x-fix expressions into y-fix expressions. Here is a great calculator which shows how to push/pop from the stack, [Prefix-Postfix Converter by raj457036](https://raj457036.github.io/Simple-Tools/prefixAndPostfixConvertor.html)
