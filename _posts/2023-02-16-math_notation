My friend said he had created his own math notation! His notation worked perfectly for him but was unreadable for others. I thought that was genius and wild that he had invented his own way of writing math. I can't imagine writing expressions in any other way!

Turns out, there are other ways.

Our standard notation is called infix. We use parenthesis to indicate the order of operations. Operators are between the two operands.

```(A+B)*C)```
