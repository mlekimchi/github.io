# The Project
My class is an intro to stats so the project is mainly lit review/light implementation. We get to choose a problem in any topic and research the current statistical analysis techniques. The goal is relate the techniques back to the topics that we have learned so far.

It was actually difficult for me to narrow down a topic! It is probably backwards but I thought about the techniques I wanted to use and then determined how the data should look. Here are concepts I want to hit in this project:
- MLE
- order statistics
- hypothesis testing
- distribution types/model fitting?
- boostrap

My plan is to get some data, fit it to a model, analytically and numerically calculate the MLE. In the process, I could bootstrap a sampling distribution of a mean/$Y_i$ order statistic. I could also set up a hypothesis test for the MLE.

In addition, I also wanted to use the EM and ranking/sorting algorithms that I wrote last semester!

## Topic/ Data
The obvious first choice would be covid: I could build a predicting model with the top symptoms. Another idea was college admission data: California state universities no longer require SAT/ACT scores [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2022/03/24/california-state-university-ends-use-of-sat-act-for-undergraduate-admissions/). Again, I could build a model for the top indicators of student success. I found a really comprehensive dataset by [College Score Card](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data).

Summer is fire season in California so wouldn't it be great if I could create a predictive model for wildfires??!? Um well just a quick lit review tells me that modeling fires is extremely complex. In fact, it seems like wildfires are somewhat chaotic? [Here](https://socsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ForestFire.html) is a model for forest fires that follows self organized criticality: [3D Abelian sandpile simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcbrIJRfsDw).

[This article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/18/1016215/complex-math-fire-modeling-future-california-forests/) goes over current fire models. The director of the US Forest Service’s Missoula Fire Lab says,

> Like any model, Wildfire Analyst is only as good as the data that feeds it—and that data is only as good as our scientific understanding of the phenomenon in question. When it comes to the mechanics of wildland fire, that understanding is “medieval”
