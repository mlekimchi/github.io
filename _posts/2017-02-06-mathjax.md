# Estimation

In my stat's class, we are using Larsen's 6th edition of `An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications.` This week, we are doing chapter 5 about estimators.

Dean Attali's [template](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) is an excellent tutorial for building GitHub pages. 
However, it did not provide solution to show LaTex symbols, which is crusial for math and statistics teachers or math-related users. 
Here's an easy way to solve this problem.

Basically, you only need add following script in your markdown file which contains LaTex inputs:

```
  <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Note that this script should appear before any LaTex inputs in your file.

It is tedious to add this script for every md file, so we can build a `_html` file in the `_includes` fold, named `mathjax.html`, 
which includes the very script mentioned above. Then we only need add one short sentence in the md file to get everything set: `{`%` include mathjax.html `%`}`. No configuration in `_config.yml` is needed! 

Yet it is still time-consuming to write the `include` things in every post. Here comes the final solution: change your `base.html` file in the `_layouts` folder in the template. Include the   `{`%` include mathjax.html `%`}` sentence into the `base.html` file, then everything is set and there is no need write the script again in every md file.


You can check my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xkdog/xkdog.github.io) to see how this works.

See how beautiful these LaTex formulas are:

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$


$$ F(x) =\int _{-\infty} ^{x} \frac {1} {\sqrt {2 \pi} \sigma} \mathrm {e}^ \frac {-(t-\mu)^2} {2 \sigma ^2 } \mathrm {d} t $$



Try it out!
